# WB2543-PET-Multitubular-Reactor-Design
Python scripts to solve the heat transfer coefficients, temperature gradients and reactant concentrations of a multitubular maleic anhydride reactor.

### Heat Transfer Coefficients
Heat transfer coefficients for three out of the four required coolant configurations are generated here. Data for these heat transfer coefficients is saved in the /data/ folder, to be used for the numerical solver script.

### Numerical solver
The differential equations of reaction rate, concentrations, and energy are solved and plotted here. Requires input data from the /data/ folder to use as heat transfer coefficients.
